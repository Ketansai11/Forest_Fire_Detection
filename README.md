# Forest Fire Detection using YOLOv9

# Project Overview
This project utilizes YOLOv9 (You Only Look Once, version 9) to detect forest fires and smoke. YOLOv9 is a cutting-edge object detection model known for its efficiency and accuracy.

# Before You Start
Ensure you have access to a GPU to expedite the training and inference process. Checking GPU availability is essential, and you may need to adjust your hardware settings to use a GPU.

# Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies
YOLOv9 is a new model, and we recommend using a specific fork that includes necessary patches for proper functionality. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies as specified in the setup instructions provided in the repository.

# Install Roboflow
The roboflow package is used to download datasets from Roboflow Universe. Ensure you have this package installed to manage datasets effectively.

# Download Model Weights
Download the pre-trained weights for YOLOv9 models. These weights are crucial for running the detection model. Verify that the weights are downloaded to the correct directory.

# Download Example Data
To run inference using example data, download an image from a reliable source. If you prefer to use your own image, upload it to the environment and update the file path accordingly.

# Inference
Run the model on the example image or your custom input. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the inference process and obtain detection results.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv9 for detecting forest fires and smoke. By following the setup instructions and utilizing the provided scripts, you can train and run the model on your own data.
